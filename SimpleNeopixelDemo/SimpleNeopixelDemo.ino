  Note that we always turn off interrupts while we are sending pixels becuase an interupt
  could happen just when we were in the middle of somehting time sensitive.
  
  If we wanted to minimize the time interrupts were off, we could instead 
  could get away with only turning off interrupts just for the very brief moment 
  when we are actually sending a 0 bit (~1us), as long as we were sure that the total time 
  taken by any interrupts + the time in our pixel generation code never exceeded the reset time (5us).
